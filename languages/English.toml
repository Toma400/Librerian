# LANGUAGE FILE
# ------------------------
# Language files are meant to support multilingualistic experience for
# Librerian. They can have any name supported by Librerian natively, or
# any name ever, if you edit 'settings.toml' manually.
#
# Keys in this file are used for user interface, so be sure to not remove
# any of them.
