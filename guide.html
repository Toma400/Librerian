    <h1><center>Welcome in Librerian Guide!</center></h1>

    Although usual Librerian experience was made to be as simple as possible, you can still want to find some clarification, or
    tutorial on a bit more complex elements of the program.

    <center><h2>What is Librarian?</h2></center>

    <b>Librarian</b> is free, open-source software developed by Tomasz Stępień (known also by nickname Toma400) since 2022.<br>
    It is <b>culture collection manager</b>, as I like to call it, allowing you to create library of various elements of culture
    you like (such as books, movies, games, anime, music and so on).<br>
    In its core functionality Librerian was made to be alternative of services such as GoodReads, IMDB, Last.fm and others.<br><br>

    Librerian, though, puts less care on having rich database for data you don't have any contact with, and <b>more care on things
    you actually store</b>. From my own user experience, I missed a lot feature of adding multiple rewatching dates, samely as
    rewatch count itself - such things will be added once Librerian development stage is finished.<br>
    Additionally, I wanted to put a lot of care on users having a way to customise their data - so not only
    you will be able to customise themes, but in the future, I plan on adding pretty easy system of expanding Librerian elements.

    So, about the customisation, let's look what is currently available (in dev-builds).

    <hr>
    <center><h2>Custom themes</h2></center>

    One of currently available customisations you can already create is <b>theme</b>, being palette of colours used by the program to showcase
    whole interface.<br>
    Themes are stored in <code>themes</code> folder, so all .toml files put there will be instantly recognised as such.<br><br>

    The easiest way of creating theme is just copying any default theme and changing in values. Here we have <code>Classic</code> theme code:

    <pre>
        <code>[Titlebar]</code>
        <code>text_colour             = "#C4A989" #| C4A989</code>
        <code>background_colour       = "#60482B" #| 60482B</code>

        <code>[Main]</code>
        <code>text_colour             = "#C4A989" #| C4A989</code>
        <code>background_colour       = "#8E704B" #| 8E704B</code>
        <code>button_colour           = "#60482B" #| 60482B</code>

        <code>[List]</code>
        <code>text_colour             = "#A86511" #| A86511</code>
        <code>background_colour       = "#D1C4B4" #| D1C4B4</code>
        <code>highlight_colour        = "#E2B277" #| E2B277</code>
        <code>text_highlight_colour   = "#8D540D" #| 8D540D</code>
        <code>scroll_colour           = "#60482B" #| 60482B</code>
    </pre>

    Text within the brackets is used as a category, so you know what part of the program keys are referring to. So, for example, <code>text_colour</code>
    in <code>[Titlebar]</code> means text appearing on titlebar of the program (the bar with minimizing/exiting symbols).<br><br>

    Themes support html colour codes (or hexcodes), which have easily recognisable "#" symbol before them. To change the colour, simply replace
    old hexcode with new hexcode within the brackets.<br>
    "#|" signifies comment, which - in this case - shows default value of the theme. Because yes, if you would like to change already available
    themes, you can work on it. Commented default values are here to help you if you'd feel you preferred old version of the theme.

    <center><h2>Translation contributions</h2></center>

    Librerian is made for English language, but it does support other languages thanks to modular system. Basically
    any .toml file you put in <code>languages</code> folder is recognised as language file. The way it works is really similar to themes, actually.<br><br>

    But, languages are thing more natively important for Librerian - since new language file means whole new nation can use the program without need of
    learning English! So, would be neat to contribute, so our language file can get added to official Librerian files, right?<br>
    Absolutely! Unfortunately, until development stage is over, I will not make Librerian GitHub public. This makes translation contributions a bit more tricky.<br>
    But worry not. At the top section, I gave you some ways to contact me - and although this way of contribution is harder, it will be greatly appreciated as well.

    <hr>
    <center><h2>Adding new types of data</h2></center>

    <b>Be aware that - even if there's tutorial here on how to create entries - during Dev-Builds, Alpha and Beta, major changes may come, resulting on you
    needing to redo your Entry to work correctly. If something like this is done, there will be migration guide for it published, though.</b><br><br>

    Creating new plugin entries is possible by creating new .py file in <code>entries</code> folder. Here are some requirements:<br>
    <ul>
        <li> It has to contain class deriving either from Entry, or other entries (so, in case of books, BookEntry). Make sure you import the class too.
        <li> It has to have constructor method <code>(__init__)</code> returning super() function
        <li> It has to override elements that are requested (i.e. custom language dictionary)
    </ul>
    Even though this sounds terrible, it is not as difficult as you may think of it after reading. Open <code>/core/elements/</code> folder. You should be
    able to find both <code>blank_entry.py</code> and <code>example_plugin.py</code> files. Remember those.<br><br>

    <!-- Previous colour: #6F419E-->
    <span style="color:#21A218"><b>blank_entry.py</b></span> is your main reference, since most of plugins will refer to this exact file, and most of explanations you will need, are documented
    exactly there (in comments).<br>
    And <span style="color:#21A218"><b>example_plugin.py</b></span> is example of how plugin entry looks - with even more explanations to each element, since this is meant to be learning tool for you.
    You can copy it over to <code>/entries/</code> folder and see all its values working, too.

    <br><br><center>
    <b>As of right now Entry creation is incomplete, so it is not possible to create anything but
        useless blueprint. I do not recommend creating Entries in current dev-build version, as a lot of code can be refactored in next one.</b></center>

    <br><br>

    <center><h2>Settings use</h2></center>

    Nowadays, most Librerian settings are accessible within it itself. However, if you would like to manually access settings (without running the program),
    you can edit <code>settings.toml</code> file.<br><br>

    So, when you open the file, you should see something like this:
    <pre>
        <code>language = "English"</code>
        <code>theme = "Classic"</code>
        <code>window = "Fullscreen"</code>
    </pre>
    Those are under <code>[General]</code> category, so you know that those settings apply to whole program and refer to common
    use of it. So, explaining them:
    <ul>
        <li><b>language</b> - this setting needs to be named with respective language file name stored in <code>languages</code> folder. It changes user interface to specific language. If language is wrongly set, it changes to default (English)
        <li><b>theme</b> - themes are colour palettes creating Librerian's look. Themes are stored in <code>themes</code> folder, and name you put in settings should be the same as file in said folder
        <li><b>window</b> - this setting changes whether or not Librerian opens with full screen, or minimised. Setting here takes <code>Fullscreen</code> value (for full screen) or <code>Small</code> (for minimised). Use of different value will make window use default value (minimised)
    </ul>
