You can freely use the software for its destined purposes, as well as edit the files for
your own needs, but you should not redistribute the files. Changing the files can be only
in two contexts:
- forking the repository to make pull request later (supporting the development)
- creating language files (see the change of license for them below)

Exception of ARR license are language files which are considered as CC-0.
All rights for translations creation belong to their respective creators and editors, though
the files are open to be edited, copied and created by anyone willing to do so.

License will be changed in the future, to open more possibilities - current ARR license
is just a placeholder for extremely early development stage.
